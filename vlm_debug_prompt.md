Analyze the attached waveform output image from [TASK] circuit which is designed by one LLM. [NORMAL_VOUT] The actual output waveform differs. [TESTBENCH]

Please provide a detailed analysis of the waveform characteristics within one paragraph, including shape, amplitude, frequency, stability, any differences from the expected pattern (e.g., DC level, decay, irregular behavior), and unusual features or distortions. 

Please describe the waveform features solely based on the image without analyzing specific circuit problems or providing modification suggestions.
